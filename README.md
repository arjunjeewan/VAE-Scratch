# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) from Scratch

This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) from scratch using PyTorch and applies it to the MNIST dataset. VAEs are generative models that learn to encode data into a latent space and can generate new data points from this space.

To run this project, clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal

``` python train.py```

You may change configurations in the ``config.py`` to optimize performance on your system.


Here are a few examples of the generated outputs of digits.
